/*You just bought a new calculator, but it seems to have a small problem: all its results have an extra 
1
1 appended to the end.
For example, if you ask it for 3 + 5, it'll print 81, and 4 + 12 will result in 161.

Given 
A and B, can you predict what the calculator will print when you ask it for 
A+B?

Input Format
The first and only line of input will contain two space-separated integers 
A and B
Output Format
Print a single integer: the calculator's output when you enter 
A+B into it.

Constraints
1≤A,B≤50*/

	int A,B;
	scanf("%d%d",&A,&B);
	int total=A+B;
	scanf("%d",&total);
	printf("%d",(total)*10+1);
